# Arena 

small text based rpg game 

## Concept 

You are alone to fight in an arena against more and more enemies, how many round can you handle ? 
- you start a 1vs1, then add one enemie every round 
- you are fully rested between every round 
- there are specials stronger enemies added from times to times... 
- turn by turn fight

The game plays by itself, but it shows you the log of the battle. Your goal is the make the best character 


##  Features 

- Playable via discord, terminal and allow easy implementation on other platform 
- Using RPG styles stats (STR, DEX, ... )
- Endless mode (until you die) or bet mode (you bet how many round you think you can do)
- Leaderboard 
- dodge, initative
- using dice rolls for damages and stats checks


## Ideas for later

~~I forgot to tell, but the enemies are in fact children~~
